# Feeding Shuting

This terminal based game was created as part of a project for a Java teaching unit (2I002) at Pierre et Marie Curie University (_Sorbonne Universit√©s, Paris_).
Our game is based on the already existing game *Feeding Frenzy*, and written in Java language.

_Note: In order to run the program, please execute the following command on the terminal._

```ruby
              javac *.java && java JeuFeedingShuting
```
